# Fitness Goals

First determine your current weight, then let's establish a reasonable goal. For example, if we aim to lost 2 lbs per week, how many weeks will it take us to lose 50 pounds? We will want to discuss this and figure out the game plan.

## Starting Point
- Weight =  lb
- Body Fat % = %

## Desired End Point
- Weight =  lb
- Body Fat % = %

## Actual Endpoint
- Weight = lb
- Body Fat % = %
