# Refeed Strategy

The main approach here is that carbs should be increased in order to provide increased satiation as well as carb stores ready to be burned the following day for a more energetic workout. 

369g carb: **+125g** = +500 cal 

64g Fat: **+10g** = +90 cal 

221g Protein: **-20g** cal = -80 cal 


*Adding 500 Calories for refeed (actual, 510 calories)*
