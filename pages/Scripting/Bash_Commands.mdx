| **find** | Finds files by filename | ``` find image.png ``` | Looking for specific files in  node libraries |  |  |
| **grep** | Finds specific text in a a specific file | ``` grep some_text  index.js``` | search for code references inside a specific file | [Reference](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/07-find/index.html) |
| **grep** to a file | Copy results of a grep search into a text file | ``` grep some_text index.js > grep_result.txt ``` | If the grep results are too large to properly analyze, such as grepping in a log file, dump into a text file for ease of use |  |  Can also use the 'pipe' instead of the 'right carrot' > to 'pipe' out text to a file, it just doens't work in this markdown syntax for reasons only I know, or you can look at the code in [github](https://github.com/smmalik3/justDaNotes/blob/main/pages/Bash/Useful_Commands.mdx) and you'll get what I mean. Or peek the [raw code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smmalik3/justDaNotes/main/pages/Bash/Useful_Commands.mdx) |
| **touch** | Creates a new file | ```touch blah.txt``` | While working in Bash, if you need to create a placeholder file quickly, use this command | [Reference](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/touch-command-in-linux) | Typically I use this when writing a new app and need an index.js file to get started, I will type ```touch index.js``` and can write a quick hello world script using VIM and run the app. |
| **top** | Shows list of all running services | ```top``` | If your app is running slow, type ```top``` to see if any processes are eating up too much CPU, it could even be your app. Find the PID (process id) and kill it. |  | See ```kill``` command below to actually kill a process |
| **kill** | Kills a specific process | ```kill 9999``` | If you need to stop a specific process |  |  |
