# Promises

## What are promises?
A Promise in JavaScript represents a value that may not be available yet but will be available in the future, or it will never be available because of an error. Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations without blocking the rest of your code.

## Components of a promise
A Promise is an object that has three states:

1. **Pending:** The Promise's outcome hasn't yet been determined, because the asynchronous operation that will produce its result hasn't completed yet.
2. **Fulfilled:** The asynchronous operation has completed, and the Promise has a resulting value.
3. **Rejected:** The asynchronous operation failed, and the Promise will never be fulfilled. In the rejected state, a Promise has a reason that indicates why the operation failed.
Here's a basic example of creating a new Promise:
```js copy
let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  // a mock async action using setTimeout
  setTimeout(function() {
    resolve('Done!');
  }, 1000);
});

promise.then(function(value) {
  console.log(value);
  // "Done!"
});
```

In this example, `new Promise` is used to create a Promise that represents a value that will be available in the future. This Promise is set to resolve with the value 'Done!' after 1 second. The `then` function is called to handle the resolved value of the Promise when it becomes available.

## Error handling in promises
You can also handle errors or Promise rejections with the catch function:
```js copy
let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  // a mock async action using setTimeout
  setTimeout(function() {
    reject('Error!');
  }, 1000);
});

promise.then(function(value) {
  console.log(value);
}).catch(function(error) {
  console.error(error);
  // "Error!"
});
```
In this case, the Promise is rejected with the value 'Error!' after 1 second. The `catch` function is called to handle the error when it occurs.

## Chaining promises
Promises can be chained together to handle complex asynchronous code:
```js copy
let promise1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    resolve('First promise');
  }, 1000);
});

let promise2 = function(message) {
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(function() {
      resolve(message + ' -> Second promise');
    }, 1000);
  });
};

promise1.then(function(result) {
  return promise2(result);
}).then(function(result) {
  console.log(result); // "First promise -> Second promise"
}).catch(function(error) {
  console.error(error);
});
```

In this case, `promise2` isn't created until `promise1` has been resolved. This allows for sequential, asynchronous operations.
