# Arrow Functions

## What are Arrow Functions?

An arrow function expression is a compact alternative to a traditional function expression, with some semantic differences and deliberate limitations in usage:

Arrow functions don't have their own bindings to this, arguments, or super, and should not be used as methods.
Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors. Calling them with new throws a TypeError. They also don't have access to the new.target keyword.
Arrow functions cannot use yield within their body and cannot be created as generator functions.

## Breaking down Arrow Functions

```js copy
// Traditional anonymous function
(function (a) {
  return a + 100;
});

// 1. Remove the word "function" and place arrow between the argument and opening body bracket
(a) => {
  return a + 100;
};

// 2. Remove the body braces and word "return" â€” the return is implied.
(a) => a + 100;

// 3. Remove the parameter parentheses
a => a + 100;
```

## General Arrow Function form

```js copy
const func = () => ({ foo: 1 });
```

The `return` is implied in arrow functions, hence it does not need to be explicitly written.
