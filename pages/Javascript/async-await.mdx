# Async/Await

## What is async/await?
The async/await feature in JavaScript is used for handling promises. Before async/await, promises were handled by chaining .then and .catch methods, which could lead to code that was difficult to read and maintain, especially with complex promise chains. Async/await syntax makes it easier to write and read code that works with promises.

## How to use async/await
Here's how you can use async/await:

1. **Async:** The `async` keyword is used to define an async function. An async function is a function that knows how to expect the possibility of the await keyword being used to invoke asynchronous code.

``` js copy
async function myFunc() {
  // ...
}
```

The async function returns a Promise. If the function has a return statement, the Promise will be resolved with that value, otherwise, the Promise will be resolved with `undefined`.

2. **Await:** The `await` keyword is used in an async function to ensure that all promises returned in the function are synchronized - in other words, they wait for each promise to resolve before moving on to the next statement.
Here is a simple example of async/await with a promise:

```js copy
function resolveAfter2Seconds() {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('resolved');
    }, 2000);
  });
}

async function asyncCall() {
  console.log('calling');
  const result = await resolveAfter2Seconds();
  console.log(result);
}

asyncCall();
```
In the above code, `asyncCall` is an async function that calls the `resolveAfter2Seconds` function. The `await` keyword is used before `resolveAfter2Seconds` to wait for the promise it returns to be resolved.

Output will be:
```js copy
calling
(wait 2 seconds)
resolved
```

Without the `await` keyword, `asyncCall` would log 'calling' and 'resolved' immediately, without waiting for two seconds.

## Keep this in mind
Keep in mind that the `await` keyword only works within an `async` function. If you try to use it in a regular function, you'll get a syntax error. Also, the function execution halts at the `await` expression and resumes once the promise is resolved/rejected, and then the value of the `await` expression is that resolved value.
