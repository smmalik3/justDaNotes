These notes are from the Deloitte/Microsoft training and covers material specifically on the AZ-900 Certification Exam

	## Cloud computing
        - These are general characteristics of **ALL** cloud providers:
		    - Compute
		    - Networking
		    - Storage
	## Cloud model comparison
		- Public Cloud
			- No capital expenditures to scale up
			- Apps can be quickly provisioned
			- Only pay for what you use
		- Private Cloud
			- Hardware must be purchased for startup and maintenance
			- Orgs have total control over resources and security
			- Orgs are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates
		- Hybrid Cloud
			- Most flexible
			- Orgs determine where to run apps
			- Orgs control security, compliance, and legal requirements
	## CapEx - OpEx
		- Capital Expenditure
			- Up front cost of physical infrastructure
			- Costs reduce over time
		- Operational Expenditure
			- Spend on products and services as needed, pay as you go
			- Get billed immediately
	## Consumption Based Model
		- Better cost prediction
		- Prices for individual resources and services are provided
		- Billing is based on actual usage
	## Cloud Benefits
		- High Availability
			- Based on SLAs - www.azure.cn/en-us/support/sla/summary/
		- Scalability
			- Expand hardware performance, upping CPU, RAM, storage, et-, can add/remove resources, can add/remove servers
			- Scale-out/Horizontal Scaling --  continue adding additional servers
			- Scale-up/Vertical Scaling -- adding more resources to existing server
		- Predictable
			- Performance and cost are what you would expect
		- Governance
		- Elasticity
			- Similar to scalability. Costs around scalability.
		- Reliability
			- How reliable are your services/servers, SLA - 24/7 service, what infrastructure azure provides you with making the resources reliabl- Reliability is in conjunction with SLAs
		- Security
		- Manageability
			- Monitoring - Alerts, Performance metrics for resources on Azure, et-
		- Agility means that you can deploy and configure cloud-based resources quickly as app requirements chang- 
		- Scalability means that you can add RAM, CPU, or entire virtual machines to a configuration. 
		- Elasticity means that you can configure cloud-based apps to take advantage of autoscaling, so apps always have the resources they nee- 
		- High availability means that cloud-based apps can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime, even when things go wron-

	1. Management Groups - IT
		- Subscriptions - DEV, TEST, UAT, PROD, et- 
			- Resource Groups -  A resource group is a container that holds all your resources
				1) Resources - Website, API, SQL Database, Storage Account. 
					a) A resource can only be used in one resource group, it can be moved to another resource group but will be removed from the one it was in initially
					
## Cloud Service Types
	1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
		- Pay as you go - most flexible cloud service
		- Take more responsibility for resources, you configure and manage the hardware for your application
		- These are managed by Microsoft
			- Servers and Storage
			- Networking firewalls/Security
			- Datacenter physical plant/building
	2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
		- Focus on app dev
		- Platform management is handled by cloud provider
		- These are managed by Microsoft

		- A management group tree can support up to six levels of depth
	11. Virtual Machines vs. Containers
		- VM is essentially a server, control resources and OS, can only run one OS at a time, or only one run time environment, if you need to leverage multiple run time environments, you'll need multiple VMs
			- VMs virtualize the hardware
			- Full control
		- Containers - Light weight solution, containerizing apps, multiple containers can run on a single server
			- Containers are often used to create solutions by using a microservice architecture
			- Containers virtualize the OS
			- -- Docker

## Compute and Networking
Azure compute is an on-demand computing service that provides computing resources such as disks, processors, memory, networking and operating systems
	1. Virtual Machines
	2. App Services
	3. Container Instances
	4. Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)
		- Container orchestrator
	5. Azure virtual desktop

## Azure Networking Services
	1. Azure Virtual Network (VNet) enables Azure resources to communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.
		- Public endpoints, accessible from anywhere on the internet
		- Private endpoints, accessible only from within your network
		- Virtual subnets, segment your network to suit your needs
		- Network peering, connect your private networks directly together
	2. Virtual Private Network Gateway (VPN) is used to send encrypted traffic between an Azure virtual network and an on-premises location over the public internet

		- GRS - Geo redundant storage - Single datacenter in the primary and secondary region - 16 Nines
			- Used for production, not for lower environments
		- GZRS - Geo-zone redundant storage - Three availability zones in the primary region and a single datacenter in secondary region - 16 Nines
			- Used for production, not for lower environments
	3. Azure Storage Services
		- Containers (aka Blob)
			- Blobs store unstructured data like CSVs, or structured data like images, audio, video, et-
		- File Shares
			- Can take all files sitting on your on premise file share and put it on Azure and can reference it the way you would if it was still on premise, such as --> P:
			- Network drive on premises to Azure network drive
		- Queues
			- Well architected framework. Basically like a message queue, messages queue up and get processed in a FIFO manner
		- Tables

		- Analyze and identify potential attacks
		- Just-in-time access control for ports
		- Dashboard tool that shows your level of protection and where to increase security

## Cost, Governance, and Management
	1. Cost Management
		- Factors affecting cost
			- Resource Type
				1) Costs are resource-specific, so the usage that a meter tracks and the number of meters associated with a resource depend on the resource type
			- Consumption
				1) With pay-as-you-go model, consumption is one of the biggest drivers of cost
			- Maintenance
				1) Monitoring your Azure footprint and maintaining your environment can help you identify and mitigate costs that aren't necessary, such as shutting down (deallocating) under utilized virtual machines
			- Geography
				1) The same resource type can cost different amounts depending on the geographic area, so geography has an impact on Azure costs
			- Network Traffic
				1) While some inbound data transfers are free, outbound data or data between azure resources is impacted by billing zones

In a rare case that a reboot is required, Service Health allows you to choose when to perform the maintenance to minimize the downtime
	
	
		
		
## Actual Exam Experience 
	1. Taken early March 2023
    2. 38 Questions
	2. 45 Minutes
	3. Passed --> Got a 760, passing score was 700
	4. Exam was more challenging than anticipate-
		- Similarity to practice exam = ~35%
		- Most challenging questions were scenario based, asking if a certain set of requirements was presented, what should be the appropriate course of action
		- Some questions around how to use resources effectively
		- Questions on monitoring were more technical than in practice exam
			- What resources can you use in Azure Monitor?
				1) Function Logs
				2) Application Insights
	5. Some tricky questions, mostly around specific language, for example, if the term "resource" is used, identify resources in the answer.
	6. Didn't review my answers, just submitted it.
	7. I don't think I would have passed the exam on my first try if I wasn't regularly using Azure for the last ~2 years, some questions were just common sense based on use, others were tricky but the answer could be extrapolated based on us-
