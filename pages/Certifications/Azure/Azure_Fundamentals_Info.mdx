# Azure - Fundamentals Certification

```
Below are the exact resources I used to prepare for and pass the Azure Fundamentals Exam
My general strategy was to go through all the training materials and immediately take either 
a free set of practice questions or take a practice test. Then I would review my practice test,
add to my notes and rinse and repeat until I was consistently getting a passing score.
**NOTE:** The Azure Practice assessment can just be refreshed to see a new batch of questions, so 
you should take that several times before starting the Udemy practice exams.
