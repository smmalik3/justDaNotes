Practice Questions and Answers
	1. Your organization has a global application running on Compute Engine. Your application contains a certain file that must be shared between multiple virtual-machine instances and zones. Which service or feature should you choose?
		a. Cloud Storage - because Cloud Storage buckets are the most flexible, scalable, and durable storage option for your VM instances and should be used when you must share data easily between multiple instances or zones.
	2. Your organization has multiple teams. Each team works independently on projects. Your Google Cloud resource hierarchy must be structured so that each team only has access to its own resources. What structure should you create?
		a. One folder per team - because folders can be used to isolate requirements for different departments and teams in the parent organization.
