# Digital Cloud Leader Notes

## What is the Cloud?
	1. Metaphor for network of datacenters that do stuff for the internet
## Types of Cloud
	1. On-premises *On prem*
		- Hosted on site
		- Located and operated within an organization's data center
		- Traditional way of managing IT infrastructure
		- Doesn't require third-party access
		- Owners have physical control
			- Need servers that 
				1. Require physical space
				2. A specialized room
				3. Require expert personnel
				4. Difficult scale
				5. Acquire more computing than actually needed
	2. Private Cloud
		- Dedicated to a single organization
		- Single-tenant or corporate cloud
		- Benefits
			- Self service
			- Scalability
			- Elasticity
	3. Public Cloud
		- On-demand availability of computing and infrastructure resources
		- No need to acquire, config, or manage resources
		- Pay only for what is used
		- Cloud computing service models
			- IaaS
			- PaaS
			- SaaS
	4. Hybrid Cloud
		- Combine public and private cloud environments
	5. Multicloud
		- Combine two public cloud provider environments
		- Most orgs embrace a multicloud strategy

		- Improve reliability and resiliency
			- Distribute core workloads across multiple cloud and on-premises infrastructures
			- Reduce downtime
			- Reduce concerns about over-dependence on a single source of failure
			iv. Improve quality and availability of a service
		f. Maintain regulatory compliance
			- Ensure compliance with regional data governance, residency, or digital sovereignty requirements
		g. Running apps on-premises
			- Freedom to innovate while still meeting legacy technology needs
		h. Running apps at remote edge locations
			- Meet performance and latency requirements
			- Run select apps at the network edge
	9. Network performance
	10. Google Cloud regions and zone
		- Locations
			- NA
			- SA
			- Europe
			iv. Asia
			v. Australia
		- Locations > Regions > Zones
		- Mult-region, store data in multiple regions that are 160km apart
		- clou-googl-com/about/locations
	11. Google's edge network
		- Store popular content near users
		- Low latency
		- Network's edge = entry point to the network
		- High performance
		- High reliability
		f. Low latency
	12. Cloud computing service models
		-  Infrastructure as a service *IaaS*
			- Compute, networking, storage, databases
			- Lease resources, only pay for what you use
			- Reduce CapEx
			iv. Compute engine
			v. Cloud storage
			v- Benefits:
				1. Economical
				2. Efficient
				3. Boosts productivity
				4. Reliable - no single point of failure
				5. Scalable - up and down rapidly
			v- Use Cases:
				1. Unpredictable workload volumes or need to move quickly in response to business fluctuations
				2. Require more infrastructure scalability and agility than traditional data centers can provide
				3. High business growth that outpaces infrastructure capabilities
				4. Unpredictable spikes in demand for infrastructure services
				5. Low utilization of existing infrastructure resources
		- Platform as a service *PaaS*
			- Provides a platform for developers to develop, run, and manage their own apps
			- No need to build and maintain the associated infrastructure
			- Can use built-in software components to build applications
			iv. Cloud Run
				1. Fully managed serverless platform
				2. Develop and host applications
			v. Big Query
				1. Enterprise data warehouse
				2. Manage and analyze data
			v- Benefits:
				1. Developers can go straight to coding
				2. No need to spend time setting up and maintaining a development environment
				3. Faster time to market
				4. Scalable
				5. Reduces management - abstracts the management
				6. Flexible - support for different programming languages and easy collaboration with distributed teams
				7. Use Cases:
					- Create unique and custom applications without investing in owning and managing infrastructure
					- Rapidly test and deploy applications
					- Have legacy applications and want to reduce the cost of operations
					- Have a new app project that they want to deploy quickly by growing and updating the app as fast as possible
					- Want to only pay for resources while they're being used
					f. Want to offload time-consuming tasks such as setting up and maintaining application servers and development and testing environments
		- Software as a service *Saas*
            - Abstracts technology completely from the consumer
			- The end user doesn't need to care about the underlying infrastructure
			- Organizations pay a subscription fee for access to a ready-to-use software product
			iv. Google Workspace
			v. Benefits:
				1. Low maintenance - Eliminates the need to have IT staff download and install applications
				2. Vendors manage all potential technical issues
				3. Helps to streamline maintenance and support for an organization
				4. Cost effective 
					- Fixed monthly or annual account fee
					- Predictable costs and per-user budgeting

				5. Flexible
					- Everything is available over the internet
					- Access to the software from anywhere, any device, anytime
				6. Use Cases:
					- Want to use standard software solutions that require minimum customizations
					- Donâ€™t want to invest time or internal expertise in maintaining applications or infrastructure
					- Need more time for IT teams to focus on strategic projects
					- Need to access apps from various devices and locations
	13. Choosing a cloud model
		- IaaS - A highly flexible scalable service, while maintaining control of infrastructure
		- PaaS - A platform designed for building software products
		- SaaS - Ready to use features without the hassle of installations
	14. The Shared Responsibility Model
		- Security in the cloud is a shared responsibility between the cloud provider and the customer
		- Customer secures data
		- Cloud provider secures infrastructure
		- Security of the cloud v. Security in the cloud
		- According to Gartner, 99% of cloud security failures will result from user error
			- id10T error
		f. How the shared responsibility model works
		g. 
		h. General guideline for responsibility is: "If you configure or store it, you're responsible for securing it."
