## Introduction to AWS
	1. Client-Server Model
		- Client - Can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with to make requests to computer servers.
		- Server - can be services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), a type of virtual server.
	2. Cloud Computing
		- Cloud-Based Deployment
			- Run all parts of the application in the cloud
			- Migrate existing applications to the cloud
			- Design and build new applications in the cloud
		- On-Premises Deployment (Private Cloud)
			- Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools
			- Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies
		- Hybrid Deployment
			- Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure
			- Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications
	3. Benefits of Cloud Computing
		- Trade upfront expense for variable expense
		- Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers
		- Stop guessing capacity
		- Benefit from massive economies of scale
		- Increase speed and agility
		- Go global in minutes

## Compute in the Cloud
	1. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2).
		- Highly flexible
		- Cost-effective
	    - Quick
	2. EC2 instance types
		- General purpose - Balances compute, memory, and networking resources
		- Compute optimized - Offers high performance processors
	    - Memory optimized - Ideal for high performance databases
	    - Accelerated computing - 
	    - Storage optimized - Suitable for data warehousing applications
	3. EC2 Pricing
		- On-Demand
			- No long term commitments
		- Savings Plan
			- Low prices on EC2 usage in exchange for a consistent amount of usage in $/hour for 1 or 3 year terms
	    - Reserved Instances
			- Suited for steady state workloads, up to 75% discount, once you commit to a 1 or 3 year term
				1. Full payment upfront
				2. Pay partial upfront
				3. Pay nothing upfront
	    - Spot Instances
			- Ideal for workloads with flexible start and end times, or that can withstand interruptions
			- Can be taken back by AWS with a 2 minute warning, good for batch processing
			- Cost savings up to 90% off On-Demand prices
			- Do not require contracts or a term commitment
	    - Dedicated hosts
			- No one can share tenancy of the host 
	4. EC2 Scalability
		- Auto Scaling - Automatically add or remove EC2 instances in response to changing application demand
			- Dynamic scaling - responds to changing demand
			- Predictive Scaling - automatically schedules the right number of Amazon EC2 instances based on predicted demand
			- To scale faster, you can use dynamic scaling and predictive scaling together
	5. Elastic Load Balancing
		- The service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances
		- A load balancer is a single point of contact for all incoming web traffic to your Auto Scaling group
	    - Low Demand period
		![Low Demand Period](../../../assets/images/aws1.png)
	    - High demand period
		![High Demand Period](../../../assets/images/aws2.png)
	6. Messaging and queuing
		- Tightly coupled architecture - Loosely coupled architecture
			- Tightly Coupled Architecture - Application A sends messages directly to Application B, if Application B fails, Application A eventually fails as well
			- Loosely coupled architecture - Single failure won't case cascading failures. Introduce a message queue between App A and App B, if App B fails, App A still sends messages to the queue, so it doesn't fail, when App B is back online, the queue can send messages to App B
		- Amazon SQS - Simple Queue Service
			- Send messages
			- Store messages
			- Receive messages
			- Between software components
			- At any volume
			- SQS is where messages are placed until they are processed
	    - Amazon SNS - Simple Notification Service
			- Sends messages like SQS
			- Can publish notifications to end users
			- Uses Pub/Sub architecture
			- Can send one message to a topic and will fan out to all subscribers in one go
			- Can fan out notifications to end users using mobile push, text, and email
			- Subscribers can all be web servers, Lambdas, or a few other options
	    - Monolithic application, has services that are all tightly coupled
		![Monolithic Application](../../../assets/images/aws3.png)
	    - Microservices - loosely coupled approach, prevents failures in other components when one component fails
		![Microservices](../../../assets/images/aws4.png)
	7. Serverless Computing
		- The term "serverless" means that your code runs on servers, but you do not need to provision or manage these servers.
		- A benefit of serverless computing is the flexibility to scale serverless applications automatically
	    - AWS Lambda - serverless computing service
			- Pay only for the compute time that you consume
			- Charges apply only when your code is running
	8. Containers
		- Containers provide you with a standard way to package your application's code and dependencies into a single object.
		- Can also use containers for processes and workflows in which there are essential requirements for security, reliability, and scalability
	9. Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)
		- A highly scalable, high performance container management system that enables you to run and scale containerized applications on AWS
		- Amazon ECS supports Docker
	10. Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)
		- A fully managed service that you can use to run Kubernetes on AWS
		- Kubernetes is an open source software that enables you to deploy and manage containerized applications at scale - aka container orchestrator
	11. AWS Fargate
		- Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers. Works with both ECS and EKS
		- When using Fargate, you do not need to provision or manage servers
			
## AWS Global Infrastructure
	1. Selecting a Region
		- Compliance with data governance and legal requirements
		- Proximity to your customers
	    - Available services within a Region
	    - Pricing
	2. Regions
		- Geographically isolated areas
		- Contain Availability Zones
	3. Availability Zones
		- An availability zone is a single data center or a group of data centers within a region
		- Located ten miles apart from each other
	    - A fully isolated portion of the AWS global infrastructure.
	4. Edge Locations
		- Store cached copy of your content closer to your customers
		- Separate from Regions
	    - Run more than CloudFront (CDN Service), run also DNS service, Amazon Route53
	    - AWS Global Accelerator improves performance for global applications by routing end-user requests to the closest AWS Region. 
	5. AWS Outposts
		- Install mini region within your own building - Owned and operated by Amazon, not used by many customers, but makes sense for folks that need data center within their own building
	6. Ways to interact with AWS Services
		- AWS Management Console
		- AWS Command Line Interface
	    - Software Development Kits
	7. Provisioning Resources
		- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
			- You provide code and configuration settings and Elastic Beanstalk deploys the resources necessary to perform the following tasks:
				1. Adjust capacity
				2. Load balancing
				3. Automatic scaling
				4. Application health monitoring
		- AWS CloudFormation (IaC)

			- CloudFormation provisions your resources in a safe, repeatable manner, enabling you to frequently build your infrastructure and applications without having to perform manual actions.

## Networking
	1. Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)
		- A networking service that you can use to establish boundaries around your AWS resources
		- Subnet - a section of a VPC that can contain resources such as Amazon EC2 instances
	2. Internet Gateway
		- Allow public traffic from the internet to access your VPC
		- A connection between a VPC and the internet
	3. Virtual Private Gateway
		- To access resources in a VPC, you can use a virtual private gateway
		- A Virtual Private Gateway enables you to establish a virtual private network (VPN) connection between your VPC and a private network, such as on-premise data center or internal corporate network (aka site-to-site vpn connection)
	    - Only allows traffic into the VPC if it is coming from an approved network
	4. AWS Direct Connect
		- A service that enables you to establish a dedicated private connection between your data center and a VPC
	5. Subnets
		- A section of a VPC in which you can group resources based on security or operational needs
		- Can be public or private
	    - Public subnets contain resources that need to be accessible by the public, such as an online store's website
	    - Private subnets contain resources that should be accessible only through your private network, such as a database that contains customers' personal information and order histories
	6. Packet - a unit of data sent over the internet or a network
	7. Network Access Control Lists (ACLs)
		- A virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level
		- Each AWS account includes a default network ACL.
			- By default, the default network ACL is stateless and allows all inbound and outbound traffic, but you can modify it by adding your own rules
			- For custom ACLs, all inbound and outbound traffic is denied until you add rules to specify which traffic to allow
			- Network ACLs perform stateless packet filtering. They remember nothing and check packets that cross the subnet border each way, inbound and outbound
	8. Security Groups
		- A security group is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for an Amazon EC2 instance
		- By default, a security group denies all inbound traffic and allows all outbound traffic.
			- You can add custom rules to configure which traffic to allow or deny
			- Security Groups are stateful and deny all inbound traffic by default
	9. Global Networking
		- Domain Name System (DNS)
			- Amazon Route 53 is a DNS webservice. This gives developers and businesses a reliable way to route end users to internet applications hosted in AWS

## Storage and Databases
	1. Instance Stores and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)
		- Block level storage volumes behave like physical hard drives
		- Instance Store Volumes - Physically attached to what EC2 instances run on, acts like physical hard drive. If you terminate EC2 instance, all data on instance store volume will be deleted. If you start up EC2 instance, it's more than likely that it will start up on another host, EC2s are virtual machines
	    - Do not write important data to the drives on EC2 instances, instead use EBS
	    - With EBS, you can create virtual hard drives that you can attach to your EC2 instance
	    - Data on an EBS can persist between starts and stops of an EC2 instance
		- Define, size, type, and configuration of EBS
		g. Can take regular snapshots of EBS volumes
	2. Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3).
		- Object Storage
			- Each object consists of data, metadata, and a key
				1. Data might be an image, video, text document, or any other type of file.
				2. Metadata contains information about what the data is, how it is used, the object size, and so on
				3. An object's key is its unique identifier
		- S3 stores data as objects in buckets
			- Can store anything in S3, backups, media files for a website, images, etc.
			- Offers unlimited storage space
			- Max file size is 5TB
			- Can set permissions on files you upload to S3
			- Can track changes of files over time using the S3 versioning feature

				1. Ideal for infrequently accessed data
				2. Similar to Amazon S3 Standard but has a lower storage price and higher retrieval price
				3. Uses: Ideal for data infrequently accessed but requires high availability when needed
			- One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone IA)
				1. Stores data in a single Availability Zone
				2. Has a lower storage price than Amazon S3 Standard-IA
				3. Uses: Want to save on storage costs, if you can easily reproduce your data in the event of an Availability Zone failure
			- Intelligent-Tiering
				1. Ideal for data with unknown or changing access patterns
				2. Requires small monthly monitoring and automation fee per object
				3. If you haven't accessed an object for 30 consecutive days, Amazon S3 automatically moves it to the infrequent access tier, Amazon S3 Standard-IA
			- Glacier Instant Retrieval
				1. Works well for archived data that requires immediate access
				2. Can retrieve objects within a few milliseconds (same performance as S3 Standard)
			- Glacier Flexible Retrieval

				2. Makes it easier to retrieve, store, and access data on AWS Outposts
				3. Delivers object storage to your on-premises AWS Outposts environment
	3. Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)
		- Amazon EBS
			- Volumes attach to EC2 instances
			- Availability zone level resource
			- EBS needs to be in the same availability zone as the EC2 instance
			- Volumes do not automatically scale to give you more storage
		- Amazon EFS
			- Multiple instances reading and writing from it at the same time
			- Linux file system (not just a hard drive)
			- Regional resource
			- Stores data in and across multiple availability zones
			- Automatically scales - can scale to petabytes without disrupting applications. Can also shrink automatically.
			- On prem servers can access EFS via AWS Direct Connect
	    - Compared to block storage and object storage, file storage is ideal for use cases in which a large number of services and resources need to access the same data at the same time.
