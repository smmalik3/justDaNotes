# Amplify

## Scratch Pad

Your project has been successfully initialized and connected to the cloud!

Some next steps:
- "amplify status" will show you what you've added already and if it's locally configured or deployed
- "amplify add *category*" will allow you to add features like user login or a backend API
- "amplify push" will build all your local backend resources and provision it in the cloud
- "amplify console" to open the Amplify Console and view your project status
- "amplify publish" will build all your local backend and frontend resources (if you have hosting category added) and provision it in the cloud

Pro tip:
Try "amplify add api" to create a backend API and then "amplify push" to deploy everything

## Under the hood

Amplify uses CloudFormation under the hood to provision and deploy backend components such as Lambdas, S3 buckets, DynamoDBs (NoSQL DBs), etc.

## Current thoughts

**Current thoughts:** Can I get Amplify to use Terraform templates instead of CloudFormation templates (CFT)? If not, is this a better way of managing deployment and provisioning of architecture when used AWS? 
Gut feeling, want to use Terraform over CFTs. But, deployment process will break down and be less manageable if Amplify doesn't allow for Terraform templates.

**Updated thoughts**: The way Amplify does things is starting to annoy me as far as the backend is concerned. I have a basic app up and running and a couple lambdas deployed, but the amplify CLI won't let me configure S3 storage without enabling auth, which is like 'wut?'

So... I am thinking of totally scrapping what I have and doing the front end separate from the backend and just making an API callout from the front end to the backend without Amplify knowing a backend exists. Will provision and deploy the backend with Terraform. Will build and deploy the front end with Amplify and Next.js

Spent 3 hours on the above, I knew *what* I wanted to build going into this, but now I know *how* I want to build moving forward.

I'm probably using Amplify wrong, but it's annoyed me enough to completely ignore using it for the backend.
