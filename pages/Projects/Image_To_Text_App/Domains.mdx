# Domains

## Google Domains
1. Google announced mid 2023 that Squarespace was acquiring their domains business. Don't know what that means for me and all my domains in Google Domains currently, but something to be aware of.
2. Cannot set ANAME records with Google Domains, this is the record that allows you to access your root domain without appending 'www' to the front.

## Amplify Domain Settings
1. When setting up DNS in Amplify, make sure to check the 'redirect to www' checkbox, since you cannot access this after setting up the DNS records.
